**A Song For Every Moon**

The debut album from Bruno Major was based on a monthly release schedule. The artwork is a hand-drawn representation of the twelve Gregorian months which encircle a globe as it orbits the sun. Each symbol is an original, instinctive representation from a northern European point of view. January, the grid. June, the high sun. September, new directions. November, memory and projection.

**To Let A Good Thing Die**

To Let a Good Thing Die is the second studio album from singer-songwriter Bruno Major, and was released on June 5, 2020 via Harbour and AWAL Recordings.

“This is not a concept album by any stretch of the imagination. It’s really a musical diary of where I’m at, at the moment. It’s a collection of songs I’m very proud of, but in terms of the subject matter, I don’t conceive them to be conceptually aligned too much. There are certain themes that run through it–just ‘cause that’s what I think about all the fuckin’ time. Like, why am I here? What the fuck is going on? Why do I love this person? Why do they love me? Am I a nice person? I dunno. All of the things that are just going through my head all the time, that’s the theme.“

**Columbo**

The album Columbo holds a special significance for Major, as it represents a period of personal crisis and reflection. It explores a mix of autobiographical and observational themes, expanding Bruno's musical boundaries and showcasing his most accomplished work to date.
